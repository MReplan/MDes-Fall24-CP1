                <p class="quote">(What do Prototypes Prototype?) "Making separate prototypes enabled specific design questions to be addressed with as much clarity as possible … It was more efficient to wait on the results of independent investigations in the key areas of role, look and feel and implementation than to try to build a monolithic prototype."</p>
                <p class="thought">Totally agree - even having separate teams air gapped as well really exercises multiple angles to attack a problem. Having a monolithic prototype runs the risk of an organization to simply tunnel-vision into it as the sole solution space…even when there was still a lot of room to explore other avenues.</p>

                <p class="quote">(What do Prototypes Prototype?) "Designers make implementation prototypes as experiments for themselves and the design team, to demonstrate to their organization the technical feasibility of the artifact, and to get feedback from users on performance issues:"</p>
                <p class="thought">I realize I’ve encountered many “implementation prototypes” over my space engineering career. We have testbeds called “flat sats” which are satellite modules splayed over a table that are functional frankensteins of the final system. Flat sats help describe what functions each subsystem does, such as GPS units providing the propulsion module the correct amount of burns, verifying the Kalman Filter algorithm that will be used for flight.</p>

                <p class="quote">(What do Prototypes Prototype?) "Know your audience. The necessary resolution and fidelity of a prototype may depend most on the nature of its audience"</p>
                <p class="thought">Absolutely! I recently accomplished this at work by showing a visual-heavy representation of the prototype towards end users and customers. I feel look-and-feel was more important to them than knowing implementation because they assume the “math” to get us there is the easy part - it’s how the product looks in their hands is was the most important part.</p>

                <p class="quote">(Programming Design Systems) "Design systems offer a different way of thinking, where the designer is forced to consider many scenarios and constraints instead of relying on a one-off design process"</p>
                <p class="thought">As a systems engineer at my work, I shake my head yes! I always think of all of the operational modes my system exercises and understand how these modes are executed in different ops scenarios while respecting constraints imposed by external factors and any assumption I hold!</p>

                <p class="quote">(Programming Design Systems) "When designers learn to not only think systematically about the design process, but also to implement those systems in software, they can build things that were not possible before."</p>
                <p class="thought">Wow what a great quote - I instantly think how getting the system down for your design enables you to generate components/residents of the design system faster. I also think about how nature has lots of mathematical patterns and how those patterns made nature resilient. I feel having a system design that is grounded by mathematical systems helps ensure that the system can scale and survive multiple generations.</p>

                <p class="quote">(Programming Design Systems) "…These colors reflect the culture around them, and you should consider your content in the same way: Does it demand lively colors or a subdued, modernist scheme? The saturation of your colors is the key to this."</p>
                <p class="thought">I feel that’s what makes having a moodboard to be very important. Moodboard captures the emotions and expressions you are targeting with your design and the photos/samples collected by the moodboard help point towards your color scheme!</p>
