    <p>*11/27 | Changelog, Major: I revisited this project to apply a universal dark-mode scheme similar to what I did for the more recent homework. Also revisited to add better documentation of this code development! </p>

    <h2>Ideation:</h2>
    <p>Inspiration - I like orbits and spherical visual elements (obviously because I have tattoos of spherical geometry) and therefore wanted to do some cool sine wave motion with some sort of sphere element. A huge inspiration source is my tattoo artist Okan Uckun as well as the geometric sphere “Sound of the Earth: Chapter 3” by Yuri Suzuki for Experiments with Google.</p>

    <h2>Draw It Up!</h2>
    <p>Start with a sketch. Per project requirements, I’m going to use sin() as my trigonometric element. Each particle is “locked” in a slot in the x-axis but can move up and down in the y-axis. The y-axis movement is dictated by sin() which also gives it an “easing” movement. </p>

    </div>
    <p>I noticed that a lot projects uses classes to manage visual elements so I’m going to use it here for each sin() wave that will be iteratively generated. My object based programming and thinking-in-parameters helped a lot here! This will also make the code modular and I can “tune” parameters to result in very different visual results. </p>

    <h2>Incremental Iterations</h2>
    <p>The sketch above helped drive my coding efforts and break it to manageable chunks. I first had to fundamentally plot particles that performed the sinusoidal movement and then add on to that the ability to plot multiple "waves" using a shifting parameter!</p>

    </div>
    <cap>Fundamentally get the particle y-movement going AND being able to plot multiple waves!</cap>

    <p> Cool! So I also wanted to explore how I can control amplitude - initially this was simple, having a variable called "amplitude" that is multipled directly outside of sin() for my y-movement:</p>

      <video src="assets/iterSample_3.mov" alt="Sample Vid 1" autoplay loop muted></video>
      <video src="assets/iterSample_4.mov" alt="Sample Vid 2" autoplay loop muted></video>
    </div>
    <cap>Seen above, example of varying the amount of waves drawn AND changing the amplitude by some constant value in pixel height!</cap>

    <p>Here's where things got interesting - constricting amplitude with a tapering effect, in this case, constrict to a sphere radius r. In my amplitude calculation " r * sqrt(1- pow((x/r), 2))"  modulates the vertical displacement of the wave at each horizontal position x, resulting in a wave shape that follows a circular arc.</p>

      <video src="assets/iterSample_5.mov" alt="Sample Vid 1" autoplay loop muted></video>
      <video src="assets/iterSample_6.mov" alt="Sample Vid 2" autoplay loop muted></video>
    </div>
    <cap>I overlayed an ellipse to confirm cicular restriction and it starts looking really cool at increasing number of waves!</cap>



    <h2>Technical Hurdle: Understanding Sin() modifiers and Circular Restriction</h2>
    <p>Although I do have a signals processing background, it's been a while thinking "in-waves" and appreciating how one can "sculpt" sin() such as multiplying sin() to affect amplitude. Paul Falstad's Wave and Oscillation applets helped me speedrun/refresh on visualizing sin() and helped create the above amplitude restrictor equation.</p>
    <p>Aside from amplitude I also had to brush up on how items within sin() affects output - in sin(ax+b) I recognize how a=Frequence and +b acts as phase shifting here! Cool effect can be achieved by augment time-variant which in this case, multiplying "this.movement". This causes waves to add sequential/ordinal variation:</p>

    <cap>Example of final iteration buy also multiplying additional offset "this.movement" which in itself is a sin() of time increment!</cap>
    <p>Overall, this was a cool activity to learn how sin() can be manipulted to showcase very mesmerizing particle movement!</p>
